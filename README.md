Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

&emsp; The project I’m submitting is the Project One Clock. It was solving how to add time to a clock.

What did you do particularly well?

&emsp; I believe I did a great job laying out the order of the code that would make it easier to read for anyone else who would pick it up.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

&emsp; Since this was an early project, it was a bit bulky due to lack of knowledge. I believe some constructors would’ve helped minimize the main code even more. 

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

&emsp; I had to refer back to the readings and examples in zyBook to help me figure out setting up functions. It was helpful to have those resources which made me realize what needed to stay in the main code and what could be broken out.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

&emsp; The skill learned from this project that will be transferable will be learning how to deconstruct code to make the main code as small as possible. Also learning to start with pseudocode is also transferable.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

&emsp; Adding appropriate whitespace and comments were necessary for this program because there were many layers to it.
